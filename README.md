# Munchkin

App deployed to Github pages: [check it out!](https://cmermingas.github.io/munchkin-vue/)

As I become more familiar with [Munchkin](http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/),
I've found that we spend a lot of time adding numbers up and down, which gets
particularly distracting in the heat of a battle when monsters start wandering and
thieves start backstabbing.

I tried some of the apps, as well as the good-old pen and paper, but none provided
a solid overview of everybody's strength and an effective way to deal with battles.

Hopefully this app is easy to use and the interface can be quickly figured out.
I'll accept actionable feedback.

I also made this as an exercise to learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). I'd like to call out
some of the utilities that helped me:

- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/)
plus the [Vue integration](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome)
- [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
